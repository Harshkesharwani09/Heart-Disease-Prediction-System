🫀 Heart Disease Prediction System

This project is a Machine Learning-based Heart Disease Prediction System that analyzes patient health data to predict the likelihood of heart disease. It aims to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in identifying potential risks early.

🚀 Features

Uses Machine Learning algorithms for accurate prediction.

Built with Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.

User-friendly interface for easy input and prediction.

Trained and tested on medical datasets to ensure reliability.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

Model: Logistic Regression / Decision Tree / Random Forest (depending on implementation)

⚙️ Installation & Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/heart-disease-prediction-system.git
cd heart-disease-prediction-system


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the application:

python app.py


OR if using Streamlit:

streamlit run app.py

📊 Output Example

Input: Patient’s health attributes (age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.)

Output: “High risk” / “Low risk” of heart disease

📌 Future Improvements

Deploy as a web application with Flask/Streamlit.
